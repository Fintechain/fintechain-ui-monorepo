# WordPress Rematch Model Generation Prompt

Create a Rematch model for [MODEL_NAME] = 'UI Model' to manage WordPress data:

1. Use TypeScript for type safety.
2. Import necessary types from the shared types file.
3. Define the state shape using TypeScript interfaces.
4. Implement reducers for updating the state.
5. Create effects for handling asynchronous actions using the WpApiService.
6. Include proper error handling in effects.
9. Include JSDoc comments for documentation.



Key considerations:
- Align the model with the corresponding WordPress entity (e.g., posts, pages, categories).

Please specify any additional state management requirements or specific WordPress data operations this model should handle.
